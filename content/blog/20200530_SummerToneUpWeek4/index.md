Woooooo baby! Week 4. How was week 3 for you?

Lemme tell you that during the tail end of week 2, I was so grateful for some of the habits I have built over the years. Learning to recognize how good your body feels from fueling it right and how it puts you in a better headspace for everything you want to do, is part of the journey.   As I believe I mentioned at the beginning of this, keeping a food journal is one thing, but keeping a food journal connected to how you feel physically, mentally and spiritually is something totally different. It’s really powerful to not only see your body change, but to truly believe and understand that you’re FEELING better. It goes so far beyond appearances. And that is the kind of feeling that is going to keep you dedicated to making healthy choices long after the motivation has died (motivation is fleeting - dedication is forever.) 

Overall I have been really impressed with this meal plan so far. Most of the new recipes I have tried have ended up being really awesome. Loved the Nicoise Salad (that dressing is going to be a new go to! Who knew what a critical staple red wine vinegar is?!) 

My birthday is also coming next week and I am looking forward to celebrating over the next couple of weeks because that is just how things roll in the Q :) (stole that from my friend [Sonrose](https://www.instagram.com/sweatwithson/?hl=en)!) Plus I think we can all agree we need a little celebration!

Realizing I should probably do a whole post on alcohol and healthy living… It’s honestly an ongoing conversation for me. I don’t think there is one “right answer” like on most health related topics but it is something to consider. I have actually written some on my experiences with taking a few months off of drinking entirely in 2019.

That said my celebration is probably going to look something like homemade tamales, my favorite [ice cream](https://frankieandjos.com/) on the planet (one of the June seasonals IYKYK) and some board/video games! Hopefully the weather will cooperate and I’ll get to spend some time outside but I remember most birthday weekends growing up as cloudy/rainy. However, Seattle has shocked me with a 90 degree one so TBD! 

Onward to my meal plan! Super important to prep for success knowing that I’m going for true balance this upcoming week.

M1/Breakfasts

**Superfood Parfait**: Ok - I have to make two confessions with this recipe as it is written. I cannot stand coconut yogurt. It legitimately tastes like feet to me. I am grateful that I digest dairy no problem and always have full fat greek yogurt on hand.  I also think pitaya has ZERO flavor. It may have a real flavor if you are able to eat it fresh in a place where it is actually grown, but I am convinced that the pitaya/dragonfruit we get in North America is purely for the color. 

So some version of a yogurt parfait, I am totally down with — just not this one.

The other smoothies are really straightforward. **Mango Blueberry** sounds like a fine combo but my freezer is packed with other fruits right now. The **Orange Dreamsicle** is also good, however there is another [older TIU recipe](https://www.toneitup.com/recipe/we-♥-food-friday-creamsicle-smoothie/) that is out of the world! It seriously tastes like an Orange Julius if you remember that place. I just might have to make that one! 

M2/AM Snack

**Snickerdoodle Mini Muffins**: Some ladies really love these but I am going to swap for the **Chocolate Beet Muffins** from the LYB series <3 These are one of my absolute faves and again healthier birthday treats!

Honestly most of the chocolate muffin recipes are quite good! I have just been craving these.

Otherwise a simple home-made protein shake or fruit and nuts sounds perfect!

M3/Lunch


**Chopped Superfood Cobb Salad:** This salad is awesome but I do make a few adjustments for myself. I typically leave out the chard, red cabbage, and red onion - I either don’t like these things or red onion unfortunately gives me a bit of a stomachache. If you love them, make sure to add them! What a nice salad base to build off of.   I also don’t love this dressing. It’s funny - I crave my ACV drink every morning but I can smell it in salad dressing and I don’t love it. I’ll probably make a version with just a different vinegar subbed in.

This would be another good one to massage your kale first. Actually one of my other favorite kale salad dressings is lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and nutritional yeast so I may just do that as the base and then add everything on top! 

**Rainbow Veggie Wrap:** I have tried so many time to get into collard green wraps and I just can’t do it! Maybe if someone makes one for me I’ll have a different tune. They are BEAUTIFUL but I would rather just have a salad.

Leftovers, other salads based on what is on hand or some spring rolls will round out my lunches!

M4/Afternoon Snack

Veggies and **Hummus!** It has been a few weeks since I have made hummus from scratch so I will definitely make a batch this week. I soak and boil my own chickpeas as much as possible so it takes a little planning but totally worth it. 

Otherwise just nuts or a protein shake! I don’t have a juicer so not going to bother with green juices although I love when I can get one out (just more challenging in the Q!) That said, if you are looking for affordable options the Trader Joe’s Cold Pressed Green Juice is awesome as is the Red Juice! **They do both have fruit so technically not a M4 option but better than so many things!

M5/Dinners 

**Sunday Stew:** Rotating through meals again and I think I have to go with the **Butternut Turkey Lentil Chili**. This is such a great TIU recipe! I know not super summery but I love it and it will feed us for days! 

The 

**Buddha Bowl** and **Coconut Crusted Mahi Mahi** I have mentioned on here already! I can’t find Mahi Mahi in stores here but I will definitely be making a version of both of these TIU staple recipes. Lately I’ve been loving halibut which is a little pricey but so so good! 

We’ll fill in any missing meals with a **Tray Bake** or **Veggie Burger Night** in lettuce wraps and then as I mentioned, I’m definitely making tamales for my birthday… And I need to get my hands on some Masa. 

That’s week 4 for you! Week 3 turned out to be another emotional one. It is heavy on the world. Seeing the continued, persistent racism resulting in the death of black folks on a daily basis (truly) is disturbing. 

I almost didn’t want to post this content or feel like it was important to bring up at this time. I also personally carry some shame from having walked away from the “frontlines” of more anti-oppression organizing, but part of that reason is I was getting sick. When I took care of myself, I have been able to show up more fully and in turn push others to not only take control of their lives, but take control of your part in improving this world — your part in educating yourself and pushing the dialogue.

We have a lot of work to do. Put your own air mask on first so you can get out there and really dig in to help others.
