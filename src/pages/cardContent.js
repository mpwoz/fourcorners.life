        <p> Besides a few key components of nutrition, there simply is not enough understanding of the human body at
          first glance to make any assumptions about what is going to work best for your individual goals -- so we don’t
          try to.</p>
        <p>Every program is customized to fit where you want to go, your preferences today, your constitution, your
          lifestyle.</p>
        <p>There is no demonization of a particular diet, nor lifting up one above all others. This program is meant to
          get you on level footing so that you can make clear and conscious nutrition choices for yourself moving
          forward for years to come.</p>

        <p>Once you are making choices for yourself, it’s time to consider the impact that you have on the world around
          you. Our food choices truly do only impact ourselves and our families, but are tied to a much larger picture.
          Food connects cultures alike and different so getting to connected to the story of our food and our impact is
          empowering.</p>
        <p>If we are going to look to long-term healthy habits, we have to consider are the choices scalable and
          accessible to all in years to come? I hope you feel a sense of proud responsibility coming out of this program
          and moving forward!</p>

        <p>For the heart, soul and physical form, our bodies must move. With extensive background in human movement, I
          believe some consistent form of movement that you love in the most important starting place. I will help you
          decipher what that might be, provide free resources and recommendations and build movement into your nutrition
          plan.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in diving into the practice of yoga, I’m also happy to take those teachings further.
          Group session classes or private lessons are available any time including the study beyond Asana (physical
          practices)</p>

        <p>In many ways synonymous with purpose, there is an element in all Four Corners programming regarding
          connecting to something greater than ourselves. In moments of fear, it is hope. In moments of uncertainty, it
          is faith. Whatever the body or tradition that you believe in, know that we are infinite beings with the
          capability to start moving our lives toward our dreams.</p>
        <p>This work is so much more than food choices, workouts or yoga poses. It is about becoming who you were meant
          to be in this lifetime and realizing full potential.</p>
